    <h1>Why pluto is called the dwarf planet?</h1>
    <h3>The International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of
      Pluto to that of a dwarf planet because it did not meet the three criteria the IAU uses to
       define a full-sized planet. Essentially Pluto meets all the criteria except one—it
        “has not cleared its neighboring region of other objects.</h3>
